# RayTracer
This is a ray tracing software. Unlike most ray tracing softwares, it aims to utilize Bezier curve to model the object and directly handle the intersection between ray and Bezier curve and Bezier surface instead of using triangulated mesh. It is expected that such techniques would be more efficient than the conventional methods.

Currently, it is only supported to be built on Windows 10. In future we may provide the Linux version.
